# Book-Recomendation-System

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a book recommendation system using a dataset of books that everyone should read at least once. The dataset includes detailed information about each book, such as its title, author, description, genres, average rating, and number of ratings received on Goodreads.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises 10,000 of the most recommended books of all time, collected in an attempt to identify more books that readers may like based on their past reading preferences. It was also collected to aid in cross-content analysis and recommendations with movies and shows datasets.
